Textures changed to dds (thianks @Deimos Rast)

0.1.3
	New animated models supplied by forum user @steedcrugeon
	Code added to control animations
	Drives can now stack

0.1.4
	Fixed UI issue

0.1.5
	Updated stacking to be a descending exponential curve for additional drives.  It is now using the formula:
		force * 1.4 ^ (-cnt)
		Where force = generated force by drive
		cnt = cnt of additional drive mode.
		So this means that the following applies to additional drives:
		Drive #		Multiplier
			2		0.714285714
			3		0.510204082
			4		0.364431487	
			5		0.260308205	
			6		0.185934432	
			7		0.132810309	
			8		0.094864506
			9		0.067760362
			10		0.048400258

	Updated display of generated force and chances to take multiple drives into account

0.1.6
	Fixed issues with config values not appearing properly in mod
	Fixed issues with stacking drives not working properly
	Fixed stacking scale
	Pre-calculated exponents to save time
