	Textures changed to dds (thanks @Deimos Rast)

0.1.3
	New animated models supplied by forum user @steedcrugeon
	Code added to control animations
	Drives can now stack

0.1.4
	Fixed UI issue

0.1.5
	Updated stacking to be a descending exponential curve for additional drives.  It is now using the formula:
		force * 1.4 ^ (-cnt)
		Where force = generated force by drive
		cnt = cnt of additional drive mode.
		So this means that the following applies to additional drives:
		Drive #		Multiplier
			2		0.714285714
			3		0.510204082
			4		0.364431487
			5		0.260308205
			6		0.185934432
			7		0.132810309
			8		0.094864506
			9		0.067760362
			10		0.048400258

	Updated display of generated force and chances to take multiple drives into account

0.1.6
	Fixed issues with config values not appearing properly in mod
	Fixed issues with stacking drives not working properly
	Fixed stacking scale
	Pre-calculated exponents to save time

0.1.6.1
	Rebuild to delete old files

0.1.6.2
	Additional debugging statements added

0.1.7.0
	Added FTL Analysis window

0.1.8.0
	Added more data to FTL Analysis window
	Fixed problem with multiple drives not being combined properly

0.1.8.1
	Fixed the display of power in the editor, thanks @Warezcrawler

0.1.8.2
	Added RSS patch, thanks @Jimbodiah

beta (planned 0.2)
	Target vessel is also FTL target. Suggested Engineering Redux mod for selecting vessels.
	Optimum altitude is min altitude over current body that has 100% success provided EC supply.
	Multiple drives stack (up to 35) but have diminished return (scaled by 1.4^-i).
	Analysis window shows all beacons and their force requirements and optimal altitudes.
	Uses CommunityTechTree mod (10.000sc to unlock largest drive).
	Uses TweakScale mod (2x drive has 2x force but 8x mass and 8x cost).
